# Iris Species Prediction Model

This repository contains a Python Jupyter Notebook for building and evaluating a machine learning model to classify Iris species. The project utilizes the famous Iris dataset, which is widely used for understanding basic classification algorithms in machine learning.

## Features
- **Data Exploration**: Visualize and analyze the Iris dataset.
- **Model Training**: Train a classification model using popular algorithms like Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, or others.
- **Evaluation**: Assess model performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall.
- **User-Friendly Code**: Designed for easy understanding and implementation by beginners.

## Requirements
To run this notebook, ensure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab or Google Colab Account
- Required libraries: `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `tensorflow`, and `scikit-learn`

You can install the required libraries using the following command:
```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
```

## Usage
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Mehtab-Sidhu/iris-classification
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd iris-classification
   ```
3. Open the notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook Iris_Classification.ipynb
   ```
4. Run the cells sequentially to explore the dataset, train the model, and evaluate its performance.

## Dataset
The Iris dataset consists of 150 samples of three species of Iris flowers (Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica). Each sample includes measurements of sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width.

The dataset is provided in this repository as `iris.csv` for convenience. You can find it in the root directory of the project.

## Results
The notebook provides insights into model performance and helps you understand the strengths and weaknesses of various classification algorithms.
